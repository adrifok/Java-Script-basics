to search beyond the end of the chain results in null.
If you look for the prototype of an array, a function, or a string, you' ll see it's an object. And that's because in JavaScript
all objects are descendants or instances of Object.prototype, wich is an object that set properties and methods to all other
JavaScript data types.*/

//JAVASCRIPT CLASSES

By creating a class with specific properties and methods, you can later on instantiate objects 
from that class, that will inherit all the properties and methods that that class has. */
